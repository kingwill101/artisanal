# Changelog

## 0.2.0

### Added

- New charting module (`package:artisanal/charting.dart`) with sparkline, histogram, heatmap, line, pie/donut, and ribbon renderers.
- New Liquid template module (`package:artisanal/liquid.dart`) with terminal UI tags and render targets.
- New physics module (`package:artisanal/physics.dart`) with forge2d integration helpers.
- Console tag parser support for style-tagged output (for example `<red>...</red>`).
- Structured TUI tracing and replay hooks for improved debugging and deterministic replay workflows.

### Changed

- Migrated widget-system implementation to `artisanal_widgets`; `package:artisanal/widgets.dart` now re-exports the widgets package.
- Split and aligned low-level UV rendering APIs with the standalone `ultraviolet` package.
- Reworked terminal image protocol handling for iTerm2, Kitty, and Sixel paths.

### Breaking

- Widget APIs are now sourced from the separate `artisanal_widgets` package; consumers should include `artisanal_widgets` in dependency resolution for hosted usage.

### Fixed

- Eliminated scroll flicker with synchronized terminal output.
- Corrected Unicode/emoji width handling and grapheme-safe truncation behavior (including variation-selector edge cases).
- Fixed style/renderer edge cases including hex color parsing and related rendering correctness issues.
- Improved input/trace runtime stability in TUI flows (including replay/capture and stream handling paths).
